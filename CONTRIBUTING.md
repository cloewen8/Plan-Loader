I not only welcome contributions, but encourage them!

# Issues
Issues are a great way to talk about the package. They can be used to *submit bugs*, *ask questions*, or even to *request features*. Even
if you just need clarification (it not only helps you, but the public).

- Keep issues *concise*.
- Try to use proper English. Spelling mistakes, grammer mistakes, jargon, and slang can all distract from the topic of the Issue.
- If you have multiple topics to discuss, create multiple issues.

**Do not submit security bugs as an Issue. Email me at
[loewencjay@outlook.com](mailto:loewencjay@outlook.com?subject=Plan-Loader%20Security%20Bug) instead.**
By telling me about security related bugs through email, you keep everyone safe, while alerting me to a danger that needs to be addressed.
In return, you will be credited for your contribution, and will have helped keep everyone safe, all while helping to improve the package's
quality.

# Pull Requests
If you want a change made, but do not want to wait for me to make it (if I do it at all), consider creating a Pull Request. They are a
great way to speed up development, while encouraging me to add the desired change.

- Keep the formatting consistent with the package. ESLint helps, but it does not account for all formatting options.
- Be sure to update related documentation (the pull request description is not enough).
- Consider writing tests for additions. Writing tests helps to show quality, and for larger additions, I may require some unit testing before I accept the pull request.

If the pull request is a major change or a new feature, create a new issue first to propose the request!
- I may not agree with the change. This allows us to work out a solution (which I am far more likely to accept).
- Consider adding a +1 and -1 reaction to gauge the public's interest.
- Someone may have a better idea or is willing to help.
